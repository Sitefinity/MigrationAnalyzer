# Sitefinity Migration Analysis Tool

This repository contains the source code for Sitefinity Migration Analysis Tool. 

## Overview

You use the Sitefinity Migration Analysis Tool to assess the state of your Sitefinity CMS project, gain visibility on which front-end frameworks (Web Forms, MVC, ASP.NET Core, or Next.js) are used in your project, and what part you need to migrate to a supported front-end rendering technology. Thus, you plan the time and resources needed to perform the migration.

When you run the Sitefinity Migration Analysis Tool, it collects information about the used page templates, pages, and widgets, and displays interactive reports. You use this report to gain insight into your project's current state and estimate the resources (people and time) you need to migrate to a modern rendering technology. You also use this tool to keep track of the progress of your migration effort and the current state of the migrated assets.
